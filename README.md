## Update Checker

This is a simple rust program which is meant to be ran continuously. It polls [this website](https://policy.cornell.edu/policy-library/interim-expressive-activity-policy) every 30 seconds to see if any changes have been made. Note that this checks for differences in HTML, so it may flag updates to the website code that don't reflect on the website, i.e. internal changes. I'll work on a tool for checking just the text of the website later, but for now, this should be useful.

## Running

I'll compile binaries tomorrow, or in other words, if you don't know how to compile the code into a program, I'll update the page with links for MacOS and Windows later.
