<strong>Interim Expressive Activity Policy&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>General Principles</strong></h3>

<p>Free and open inquiry and expression is one of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cornell.edu/about/values.cfm">university’s core values</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;As recognized by the Cornell Policy Statement on Academic Freedom and Freedom of Speech and Expression (the “<a href="https://theuniversityfaculty.cornell.edu/the-new-faculty-handbook/statement-on-academic-freedom-and-freedom-of-speech-and-expression/">Academic Freedom Statement</a>”), Cornell has traditionally encouraged the free exchange of ideas, robust debate and dissent, peaceful protests and demonstrations, marches, picketing, rallies, signage and postering, displays and other symbolic speech, the distribution of information, and other means of communicating viewpoints and opinions (collectively, “expressive activity”) as essential to the university’s purpose.&nbsp; The Academic Freedom Statement and this Policy on Expressive Activity (“Policy”) establish expectations for Cornell students, faculty, and staff (“Cornellians”) engaged in expressive activity in university programs, activities, facilities, and spaces along with other reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions that the university may establish.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong><em>Free Expression Responsibilities in a Community of Belonging</em></strong></h4>

<p>As members of a residential living and learning community, Cornellians engaging in expressive activity are expected to conduct themselves responsibly and in accordance with this Policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;All Cornellians, individually and collectively, are responsible for respecting the rights of other community members and their sponsored guests under this Policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Infringement upon the rights of others to speak and to be heard, or interference with the peaceful and lawful use and enjoyment of university premises, facilities, and programs, is never acceptable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When engaging in expressive activity, Cornellians should remember that they speak for themselves only and are responsible for their own speech.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cornellians may not attribute their speech to the university, unless they are university spokespersons acting within the scope of their duties.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor may the speech of sponsored guests be attributed to the university.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, the occurrence of an event or activity at the university should not be interpreted to mean that the university endorses, supports, refutes or disagrees with its subject matter or content.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Expressive activity may not compromise public safety, impede the free movement of people or vehicles, damage university property, or interfere with regular university operations, as determined by the university.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this Policy, expressive activity must also comply with all applicable university policies and with facility rules and regulations, including but not limited to occupancy limits, fire codes, and hours of operation. Expressive activity that unreasonably interferences with another’s quiet enjoyment of their living space is not permitted.</p>

<p>Participants must also adhere to all local, state, and federal laws.</p>

<p>As a non-profit institution, Cornell is prohibited by federal tax law from engaging in political campaign activity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, Cornellians may not use Cornell resources to engage expressive activities that qualify as political campaign activity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more information, see&nbsp;<a href="https://policy.cornell.edu/policy-library/political-campaign-activity">Policy 4.18, Political Campaign Activity</a>.</p>

<h4><strong><em>Policy Administration</em></strong></h4>

<p>This Policy will be administered in a content-neutral manner and without regard to the message or viewpoint being expressed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cornellians, however, who engage in activity that violates this Policy will be referred to the appropriate office for disciplinary action. Sponsored guests who engage in activity that violates this Policy may be subject to criminal or civil penalties.</p>

<h3><strong>II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>Scope</strong></h3>

<p>This Policy applies to expressive activities conducted by Cornellians and by sponsored university guests that involve the use of university resources.<a href="//9C445037-3C3A-43F9-97C9-893BAA972C2F#_ftn1">[</a><a href="#Footnote-1">1]&nbsp;</a> For purposes of this Policy, “university resources” means Cornell facilities and other properties owned or controlled by the university; funds; branding (e.g., name or marks of the university or any of its colleges or subunits) or other resources owned or administered by Cornell.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The use of university resources for expressive activities is restricted to Cornellians and to sponsored university guests.&nbsp;&nbsp;No other individuals or groups may use university resources for expressive activity of any kind.&nbsp;&nbsp;Units that are responsible for administering university resources retain discretion over the responsible use of those resources, including their use for expressive activity by Cornellians or by sponsored university guests, consistent with this Policy and other university policies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>To become sponsored university guests for purposes of this Policy, external groups or individuals must be formally sponsored by one of the following: (a) a college or school, academic department, or administrative unit of the university; (b) a registered university-sponsored student organization and its affiliated office/department/unit; (c) a registered independent student organization; or (d) a Cornell shared governance body (e.g., Faculty Senate, the assemblies).&nbsp;No other Cornell individuals or groups may sponsor university guests for expressive activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>University sponsors are responsible for overseeing their sponsored guests and activities while on university owned or controlled property and must have a representative present during the actual event or activity.&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, the university sponsor is responsible for ensuring compliance with this Policy and other university policies.&nbsp;&nbsp;University sponsors are also responsible for obtaining appropriate approvals for use of university resources for expressive activities from the unit that administers the resource.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This Policy, however, is not intended to supersede or interfere with existing space registration procedures for the management of non-public curricular programing (e.g., classrooms, labs, research activity) overseen by academic units such as scheduling courses or course-related activities; nor does this Policy proscribe guidelines for faculty management of non-public curricular programming.</p>

<p><a href="//9C445037-3C3A-43F9-97C9-893BAA972C2F#_ftnref1">[1]</a> <a id="Footnote-1" name="Footnote-1"></a>This Policy does not intend to nor should result in the interference with any rights of Cornell employees to engage in protected activity under the National Labor Relations Act.</p>

<h3><strong>III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>Event Planning</strong></h3>

<p>This Policy outlines expectations for hosting events consistent with public health, public safety, and business operational considerations for the following types of campus expressive activities:&nbsp;&nbsp;speakers, artistic performances, and programs; outdoor events; indoor events; postering, signs, and chalking; installations; and outdoor camping.&nbsp;&nbsp;Event organizers are responsible for ensuring their events comply with this Policy and other university policies.</p>

<p>Event organizers should be prepared to address the following considerations:&nbsp;</p>

<ol class="lower-alpha">
	<li>
	<p>protecting health and safety;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>preventing damage and risk of damage to university grounds and property;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>preserving unimpeded mobility on pathways, streets, and within buildings, including entrance to and departure from buildings;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>avoiding interference with other university activities;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>reasonably limiting costs to the university of increased campus police protection, event safety staffing, medical resources, potential university liability, insurance coverage, and cleanup and repair after an event; and</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>preserving campus aesthetic values.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>In rare cases, Cornell, in its sole discretion, may disallow or prohibit activities based on the foregoing factors. These factors will be applied in a content-neutral manner. Advance registration enables the university to appropriately address health and safety concerns and to help organizers plan for a successful event.&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure to register may impact the successful implementation of the event. For more information on scheduling events, see the campus specific links below.</p>

<p><strong>Cornell Tech:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://studentaffairs.tech.cornell.edu/student-life-2/space-and-event-guidelines/"><strong>Student Event Guidelines&nbsp;</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<h4><strong>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speakers, Artistic Performances, and Programs</strong></h4>

<p>Members of the university community may work with an appropriate university body (see Section II above) to seek formal sponsorship of external speakers, artists and performers, and to organize events using university resources, pursuant to the requirements of this Policy and the approval of the unit that administers the resource.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cornell values free and open inquiry and expression even of ideas considered controversial, wrong, or offensive.&nbsp;&nbsp;A speaker or performer has the right to speak without intimidation and the audience has the right to hear what the speaker has to say. Debate, dissent, and protest are all appropriate ways to register one’s disapproval of the content of another’s speech, so long as they do not interfere with a speaker’s ability to communicate or the audience’s ability to hear and see. Heckling, interruptions, and other acts that intentionally attempt to disrupt speakers or events are wholly unacceptable.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outdoor Events</strong></h4>

<p>Cornell students, faculty and staff and their invited guests may participate in outdoor picketing, marches, rallies, protests, counter-protests, vigils, and other outdoor demonstrations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Organizers should plan the time, place, and conduct of demonstrations wisely to avoid disrupting classrooms, libraries, auditoriums, laboratories, living units, administrative offices, and special event venues.&nbsp;&nbsp;Organizers are also responsible for complying with all public health and safety requirements.</p>

<p>Outdoor demonstrations may not:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>disrupt the regular conduct of university teaching, research, business, or other activities, including (without limitation) the activities of groups who have previously reserved particular space;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>impede access to or from university property or campus roads;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>endanger the safety of others or pose risk of property damage;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>use weapons, including firearms (defined as any projectile-firing device including rifles or shotguns), ammunition, explosives, or other dangerous weapons, instruments, or substances. or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>use sticks, poles, or other items that could be used as weapons.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indoor Events</strong></h4>

<p>Cornell students, faculty and staff may participate in indoor demonstrations, tabling, or other expressive activity consistent with applicable building rules or restrictions and consistent with this Policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Registration is expected for all such activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Organizers are responsible for complying with all building rules and public health and safety requirements.</p>

	</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that living units, private laboratories and offices, dining halls, and libraries, are&nbsp;<strong>never</strong>&nbsp;appropriate locations for indoor demonstrations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Postering, Signs, Chalking</strong></h4>
